# Fast64 IK Baker
### One-click animation baking for use with Ocarina of Time IK rigs
Without context, you will not be able to use this tool properly!

[Watch my tutorial on Ocarina of Time IK Rigging first!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oW5ONxbSV0)

## Usage
1. Import and run bakeanims.py
2. Select your rig's armature
3. Press SPACE and search for '(IK) Bake Animation', run it
4. That's it.

## What is this? Why do I need it?
If you watched my video and have gone along with it, you'll notice that baking the animation is quite a hassle.
Selectively baking everything but the root bone, then baking the root bone itself, its annoying, and wastes time.
I made this tool to make it oh so much simpler. Just click. That's it.
